2. Google everything you're not understanding. When you find something that you find useful, bookmark it to an appropriate folder.
    * Let's say you're struggling to grasp floats in CSS.
    * After a bit of Googling, you find a good resource.
    * Bookmark the page (âŒ˜ + d / control + d), and in this dialogue box, either select a corresponding bookmarks folder from the dropdown menu or create a new one.
3. Ask questions. If you don't understand something do not be afraid to ask questions. Asking a simple question can save you time and possibly a headache.
