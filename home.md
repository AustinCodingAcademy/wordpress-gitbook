#Welcome - 331 Developing Wordpress for Publishers

Our philosophy is "learn by doing". We engage our students in the problem solving process as opposed to relying heavily on lectures. Our instructors, who are real developers, facilitate learning through guiding your progress as you work through projects.

## Summary 
The goal of the class is to prepare students and to help them understand Wordpress Theme Development. The issues and roadblocks that will come with building a Wordpress website and how to fix them. We will discuss also SEO development and analytics. How to use it to improve search rankings and how to use the analytic tools to improve SEO even further. Lastly we will be discussing email marketing on why it is important and still widely used as well as developing email templates to be used in the many email marketing platforms out there. 

##Weekly Prep
* Students are expected to spend their weekends preparing for the next week of class by watching videos, reading tutorials, and working examples.
* Additionally there is a "Career Readiness" reading, video, or activity each week. Thus each week you will learn important skills that will help you secure employment upon completion of the course.
* Failure to complete the work outside of class will lead to failure in the class.

## Projects
* Class time is spent applying the learning objectives.
* The projects are designed to require students to use what they've learned to solve real life problems.
* Projects should be completed in class when there is an instructor and TA in the room to provide assistance.
* Failure to ask questions will lead to failure in the class.
