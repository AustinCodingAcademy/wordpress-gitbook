#Welcome

Our philosophy is "learn by doing". We engage our students in the problem solving process as opposed to relying heavily on lectures. Our instructors, who are real developers, facilitate learning through guiding your progress as you work through projects.

To be successful in this course, you must spend 10-15 hours outside of class completing "Next Week's Prep". Our class structure follows the flipped classroom model where students learn on their own and bring their questions to class. Class begins by discussing the "Key Questions" and the majority of class time is spent working on projects. The last 20-30 minutes of class is dedicated to presenting projects.

Much of learning to code means understanding what is possible. Students are not expected to memorize anything. The important thing is that students are able to ask the right questions to find answers and solve problems.


#Workbook

All of your work will be stored in a git repository. You can find it here. Directions for using the workbook are in git lesson - Week 1 Day 2.

#Weekly Prep

Students are expected to spend their weekends preparing for the next week of class by watching videos, reading tutorials, and working examples.
Additionally there is a "Career Readiness" reading, video, or activity each week. Thus each week you will learn important skills that will help you secure employment upon completion of the course.
Failure to complete the work outside of class will lead to failure in the class.
Key Questions

You should come to class able to answer most of the Key Questions.
Instructor will start class by reviewing them. This is an opportunity for students to demonstrate what they learning during Prep.
Instructor will explain and show demonstrations to answer any questions.
Projects

Class time is spent applying the learning objectives.
The projects are designed to require students to use what they've learned to solve real life problems.
Projects should be completed in class when there is an instructor and TA in the room to provide assistance.
Failure to ask questions will lead to failure in the class.
Presentation

It's one thing to write code and another thing to talk about it.
We believe that our students need to be able to do both.
Practicing with presentation will lead to better outcomes in interviews and your career. You will be able to work better on a team and justify your code to clients and supervisors.
Our students are constantly in the driver's seat, pushing their learning forward with hard work, collaboration, and creativity. Good luck!

#Major Grades

You will complete 3 checkpoints. Checkpoints are equivalent to tests and will show your instructor how you are doing in the class. Checkpoints are completed over the weekend to save class time. Checkpoint projects will be explained on the last class day of the week and due the first class day of the next week. Checkpoints will be hosted on github pages and you will submit the link to your checkpoint via Campus Manager assignment submission.

Checkpoint 1 will be completed during the weekend between Week 3 and Week 4.
Checkpoint 2 will be completed during the weekend between Week 6 and Week 7.
Checkpoint 3 will be completed during the weekend between Week 9 and Week 10.
All of these projects must be completed and you must have an average grade of 70% or higher to receive credit for completion of this class.
