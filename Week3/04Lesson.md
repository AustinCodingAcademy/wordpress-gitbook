## Activity
I will pretend to be a client and you will sell me on moving away from a AWS server to another hosting provider of your chosing. 

## Helpful Tips For Pitching to a client
1. Know what you are talking about. Research research research.
2. Don't just know 1 hosting provider, learn the strengths and weaknesses of them all even the ones you are not affilated with. 
3. When pitching to a client, always put yourself on the other side. Switching hosting providers can be a scary undertaking especially switching from one that someone has used for a long time.
4. Transprancy is king, a client doesn't like being shocked by costs or the service. 
5. Mirror Practice: Practicing in front of the mirror isn't something that the sims do. Practicing how to talk and how to discuss work in front of the mirror can help give you guidence. A client won't trust someone if they are shy and soft spoken and can't answer questions unless its mumbling.
